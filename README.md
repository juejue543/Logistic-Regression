# Logistic-Regression
Implementing Logistic Regression on Breast-Cancer Data. A pretty simple classification algo that I have learned during my training at Sem;colon Project!

This repository contains a Logistic Regression model designed for the binary classification task of predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign. The model uses tumor-related features as input and provides a probability score for malignancy.

Logistic Function (Sigmoid): A sigmoid function maps the linear combination to a probability score between 0 and 1.

Thresholding: Tumor classification is determined by comparing the sigmoid output to a threshold (typically 0.5).
